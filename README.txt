This Chrome extension folds the site banner on Wikipedia, and all other
Wikimedia sites (Wikimedia, Wiktionary, WikiQuote, WikiBooks, WikiSource,
WikiNews, Wikiversity, WikiSpecies, MediaWiki, Wikimedia Commons, et c).

When a site banner is removed, a little page icon with a crossed-over
Jim Wales shows up at the far right of the page's address field, which,
if clicked, toggles the banner back on (and off), for the current page.
